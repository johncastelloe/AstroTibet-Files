  <h1>About AstroTibet and Liberation Prison Project</h1>
  <p>All proceeds from the sale of AstroTibet support the work of Liberation Prison Project, which offers spiritual advice and teachings, as well as books and Dharma courses to men and women in prison around the world interested in exploring, studying, and practicing Buddhism.</p>
  <p>Liberation Prison Project is a social service program of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (fpmt.org).</p>
  <p>In 2017 we celebrate 21 years of offering Dharma in prisons. We are delighted to again offer the Liberation calendar, prepared by astrologer Nawang Thartho, based on the Tibetan Medical and Astrological Institute's calendar, with additional advice from Lama Zopa Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of FPMT and Geshe Nawang Dakpa, astrologer lama of FPMT's Tse Chen Ling in San Francisco.</p>

    “Physically in the house of no release, but when the mind is practicing Dharma it becomes the house for achieving ultimate real liberation from the real samsaric prison.”
