    <h1>AstroTibet Help</h1>

  <p>On the <a href="<%= url_for :action=>:load_day_type %>">Upcoming</a> tab are listed twenty-one kinds of <b>auspicious days</b> and seventeen <b>inauspicious days</b> for various activities. Among these are <b>favorable</b> and <b>unfavorable</b> days according to the combination of elements: <b>earth</b>, <b>air</b>, <b>fire</b> and <b>water</b>, which impact on the effectiveness of one’s activities as well as one’s health. According to our astrologer Nawang Thartho, “Tibetans rely heavily on the influence of the elements and check them every day.”</p>
  <p>The <b>favorable</b> days are listed in order of the <b>most favorable</b> to <b>least favorable</b>; and the <b>unfavorable</b> days in order of <b>least unfavorable</b> to <b>most unfavorable</b>. There are also categories called <b>Unfavorable Day</b> and <b>Very Unfavorable Day</b>, which sometimes fall on one of the favorable element days; their influence is more powerful.</p>
  <p>As always, many Tibetan days are either <b>missed</b> or <b>repeated</b>.</p>
  <p>According to our astrologers, on Tibetan double days, Tsog should always be done on the first day; Fire pujas should be done only when listed. Naga, Medicine Buddha, Tara, and Protector pujas can be done on both days.</p>
  <p>If you must do activities that should be avoided on inauspicious days, Rinpoche advises that practices be done to counteract the obstacles; consult an astrologer or lama about which practices are best.</p>

  <h2>No Cutting Hair Days</h2>
  <p>Lama Zopa Rinpoche translated <em>The Sutra Chapter of Bodhisattva's Hair, Pacifying the Date of Cutting Hair</em> giving the results of cutting one's hair on various days. This advice applies to ordained and lay people alike. The days mentioned are from the Tibetan calendar. We include them here for your easy reference.</p>
